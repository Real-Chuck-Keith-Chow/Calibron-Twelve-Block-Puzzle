# Calibron-Twelve-Block-Puzzle
Calibron-Twelve-Block-Puzzle is based on a wooden puzzle made by Thomas Edison's son, where you have to put the extra piece on the right into the square. Length and width of all the pieces are 
given. My Java code opens a window on a computer and tries all the possible solutions to the puzzle! Feel free to download the code and check out what it does!
